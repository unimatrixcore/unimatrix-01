# Workspace map

This page maps the current repo tree to ownership boundaries. Use it when you
need to decide where code, docs, content, or infra changes belong.

## Current repo tree

The tree below reflects the current live workspace layout.

## Reserved roots

The paths below are intentionally reserved but are not current live
workspaces or content roots.

- `apps/workers`
- `content/docs`
- `content/notes`
- Future packages such as `packages/bmd-parser`

Do not describe these paths as existing runtime surfaces until they are
actually checked in and wired into the workspace.
